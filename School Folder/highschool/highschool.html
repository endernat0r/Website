          Electromagnetic Spectrum and Light Reflection
        </h2>
        <p>
          The electromagnetic spectrum includes different wavelengths of light. The light we can see with our eyes is only a small part of the spectrum. The PACE satellite analyzes the color of water by measuring the light reflected from the ocean surface. <br>
          Questions: <br>
          What is the electromagnetic spectrum, and which part does visible light cover? <br>
          Which colors penetrate deeper into the ocean surface, and why? <br>
          Why is it important to analyze the color of the ocean? </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Photosynthesis and Phytoplankton Activity</h3>
          <p>
          Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and phytoplankton to produce energy. The PACE satellite evaluates the activity of phytoplankton by measuring the chlorophyll concentration in the ocean. <br>
          Questions: <br>
          What components are used in the process of photosynthesis? <br>
          Why are phytoplankton so important in the marine ecosystem? <br>
          What kind of information does chlorophyll concentration provide about phytoplankton activities?</p>

          <hr>

          <h4>Chlorophyll and Biological Productivity</h4>
          <p>
          Chlorophyll is the green pigment used by phytoplankton. The chlorophyll concentration in the ocean is an indicator of biological productivity. <br>
          Questions: <br>
          What is chlorophyll, and what is its function? <br>
          Why is it important to measure chlorophyll concentration?</p>

          <hr>

          <h5>Carbon Cycle and Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction</h5>
          <p>
          The carbon cycle is the circulation of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, and plants. The PACE satellite examines the role of oceans in the carbon cycle. <br>
          Questions: <br>
          What is the carbon cycle, and what role do oceans play in this cycle? <br>
          How do phytoplankton contribute to the carbon cycle? </p>

          <hr>

          <h6>Ocean Ecosystems and Biological Diversity</h6>
          <p>
          Ocean ecosystems are complex structures that sustain marine life. The PACE satellite monitors biological diversity in the ocean. <br>
          Questions: <br>
          What is the role of phytoplankton in ocean ecosystems? <br>
          How does biological diversity affect the health of ocean ecosystems? </p>

          <h1>Ocean Color Index (OCI) and the Importance of Ocean Color</h1>
          <p>
            The PACE satellite measures the color of light reflected from the ocean surface using the Ocean Color Index (OCI). These measurements are critically important in determining biological activity in oceans, water quality, and nutrient cycles. <br>
          Details: <br>
          Ocean color changes based on the presence of particles, dissolved organic matter, and phytoplankton in the water.
          OCI detects the concentration of chlorophyll and other pigments to determine phytoplankton density.
          Important Questions: <br>
          What is OCI, and why is it important to measure ocean color? <br>
          What environmental factors do changes in ocean color indicate? <br>
          </p>

          <h2>Chlorophyll Concentration and Phytoplankton Activities</h1>
          <p>PACE monitors the amount of chlorophyll in the ocean, evaluating biological productivity and phytoplankton activities. Phytoplankton absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, produce oxygen, and form the basis of the food chain. <br>
          Details: <br>
          Chlorophyll is the green pigment that allows phytoplankton to perform photosynthesis.
          An increase in chlorophyll concentration indicates a rise in phytoplankton population and a healthy marine ecosystem. <br>
          Important Questions: <br>
          What is chlorophyll, and why is it important for phytoplankton? <br>
          How do changes in chlorophyll concentration affect marine ecosystems?</p>

          <h3>Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and the Photosynthesis Process</h3> <p>
          PACE determines the amount of light usable for photosynthesis that reaches the ocean surface by measuring Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). <br>
          Details: <br>
          PAR covers light in the wavelength range of 400-700 nanometers and is necessary for photosynthesis.
          PAR levels affect the growth rate of phytoplankton and biological productivity. <br>
          Important Questions: <br>
          What is PAR, and why is it critical for phytoplankton photosynthesis? <br>
          How do PAR data affect ecosystem health and primary production? </p>

          <h4>Atmospheric Aerosols and Their Effects on Climate</h4> <p>
          The PACE satellite researches the effects of atmospheric aerosols on climate change and air quality by monitoring their distribution and properties. <br>
          Details: <br>
          Aerosols are solid or liquid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, and salt particles.
          These particles can reflect or absorb sunlight, affect cloud formation, and thus alter Earth's energy balance. <br>
          Important Questions: <br>
          How do aerosols in the atmosphere affect climate and air quality?
          How does the PACE satellite collect and analyze aerosol data? </p>

          <hr>

          <h5>Carbon and Energy Exchange Between Oceans and Atmosphere</h5> <p>
          PACE monitors the carbon and energy exchange between oceans and the atmosphere, providing important information about the global carbon cycle and climate change. <br>
          Details: <br>
          Oceans absorb approximately 30% of atmospheric carbon dioxide, helping to regulate the climate.
          Phytoplankton convert carbon dioxide into organic matter through photosynthesis, facilitating the transfer of carbon to the ocean floor. <br>
          Important Questions: <br>
          How does the carbon exchange between oceans and the atmosphere occur? <br>
          How do these processes affect global climate and the carbon cycle? </p>
