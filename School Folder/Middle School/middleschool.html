        <h1>The Atmosphere and Its Layers</h1> <p>
        The atmosphere is the gas layer surrounding Earth and consists of four main layers: Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, and Thermosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer where weather events occur and where humans live. The stratosphere is where the ozone layer is located, blocking harmful UV rays. The mesosphere is where meteors burn up, and the thermosphere is closest to space. The PACE satellite monitors how gases and aerosols are distributed in these layers. Knowing these layers of the atmosphere helps us understand where aerosols concentrate. <br>
        Questions: <br>
        How many layers does the atmosphere consist of, and what are the characteristics of these layers? <br>
        Which layer of the atmosphere is where weather events occur? </p>

        <h2>Air Pollution and Aerosols</h2> <p>
        Aerosols are a component of air pollution and can be both natural and man-made. Natural events like volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and sea salt mix aerosols into the atmosphere, while vehicle exhaust gases, industrial activities, and fossil fuel use are the main causes of man-made aerosols. These small particles can remain suspended in the air and affect the climate by reflecting sunlight. The PACE satellite measures the global distribution of these aerosols, researching the effects of air pollution and their roles in climate change. <br>
        Questions: <br>
        How are man-made aerosols formed? <br>
        How do aerosols contribute to air pollution? </p>

        <h3>Winds and Ocean Currents</h3> <p>
        Winds are important factors affecting the movement of water on the ocean surface. Wind drags the water on the ocean surface, forming ocean currents. Ocean currents affect the distribution of small marine creatures like plankton. As wind speed increases, the movement of water accelerates, bringing nutrients to the surface. This contributes to the enrichment of marine life. The PACE satellite observes how wind speeds and directions change ocean currents. <br>
        Questions: <br>
        How do winds affect ocean currents and the distribution of plankton? <br>
        Why is it important to monitor wind speed and direction? </p>

        Water Cycle and Water Vapor
        The water cycle is the process where water evaporates from oceans, mixes into the atmosphere to form clouds, and returns to Earth as rain. Water vapor is an important component in the atmosphere and directly affects cloud formation, precipitation amounts, and air temperature. The PACE satellite monitors the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere, providing important information about precipitation forecasts and climate changes. <br>
        Questions: <br>
        How does water vapor form in the atmosphere, and how does it contribute to cloud formation? <br>
        How does the distribution of water vapor affect weather and precipitation?<br>
        Practical Mini Experiment: <br>
        You can better understand the water cycle by doing a simple experiment in the classroom. Place a glass of water near a window or a heating device. After a while, you will see evaporation on the surface of the water. If you place a plate or a transparent lid over the glass, you can observe the vapor condensing into water droplets. This experiment helps you visually understand the processes of evaporation and condensation of water. </p>

        <h6>Marine Pollution, Climate Change, and the PACE Satellite</h6>
        Marine pollution and climate change pose serious threats to ocean ecosystems. NASA's PACE satellite uses advanced technologies to monitor and understand these issues. PACE detects harmful algal blooms (HABs), changes in plankton density, and turbidity caused by pollution by observing color changes occurring in oceans. In this way, negative changes in marine ecosystems can be detected early.
        Additionally, the PACE satellite can monitor the pollution levels of oceans by tracking chemical pollutants in the water (industrial waste, agricultural chemicals, oil spills). By detecting the light scattering caused by microplastics, it helps determine the density of these small plastic particles on the sea surface. Low oxygen levels in oceans create "dead zones," negatively affecting marine life. PACE identifies these regions by analyzing biological changes and the biochemical composition of the water.
        Climate change is a process that occurs due to the increase of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, accumulating in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels and human activities. Oceans absorb a large portion of this carbon dioxide, trying to balance climate change. The PACE satellite helps us understand the effects of climate change by monitoring the role of oceans in this process and how marine ecosystems absorb these gases.
        Questions: <br>
        What methods does the PACE satellite use to detect marine pollution? <br>
        How do microplastics affect marine ecosystems, and how does PACE detect them? <br>
        What are "dead zones," and how does PACE identify these regions? <br>
        How do pollutants coming from the atmosphere contribute to marine pollution? <br> 
        How does carbon dioxide accumulate in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change? <br>
        How do oceans absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, and how does this affect climate change? </p>
