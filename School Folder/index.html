            <h3>The Mysterious World of Oceans and the Food Chain</h3>
            <p>
                Our world is largely covered by oceans. These massive bodies of water make up about 70% of Earth's surface. 
                Seas and oceans are much bigger and deeper than we can imagine. Learning the locations of oceans on maps helps 
                us understand Earth's geography. By learning the directions of north, south, east, and west, we can easily find 
                where oceans and continents are located. This basic geography knowledge is very important for exploring oceans 
                and other natural formations.

                
                <br><br>
                Living creatures need water, food, and oxygen to sustain their lives. Many species also live in oceans. 
                Creatures like fish, plankton, and corals are important parts of the ocean ecosystem. The food chain shows 
                how these creatures are interconnected. For example, plankton are a food source for small fish, and small 
                fish are eaten by larger fish. This chain helps us understand the life cycle of oceans.

                <li>
                    How much of the Earth is covered by oceans?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What directional knowledge do we need to find the locations of oceans on Earth?

            <h3>Water Cycle, Natural Events, and Scientific Observations and Experiments</h3>
            <ul>

                    <p>
                        The water cycle shows how water moves in nature. Water evaporates due to the sun's effect, 
                        forms clouds, and returns to Earth as rain. This cycle ensures the continuous renewal of water 
                        sources like oceans, rivers, and lakes. At the same time, winds contribute to the formation of
                         waves and air movements in oceans. Understanding these cycles in nature helps us better understand
                          weather events and what happens around us.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Making observations is very important in scientific studies. We can learn by carefully observing events 
                        and changes around us. For example, we start to understand how water evaporates or how wind blows by
                         observing them. We can reinforce what we've learned by doing simple experiments. The data we obtain 
                         while making scientific observations guide us in drawing conclusions and understanding how nature works.

                        The PACE satellite measures the temperatures on the surfaces of oceans, determining where the water 
                        is warm or cold. Ocean surface temperature affects both marine life and weather conditions. 
                        For example, in warm regions, water evaporates to form clouds and can cause rain. Therefore, 
                        knowing the surface temperature of oceans is very important for understanding the climate.

                        <br> <br>
                       
                        Plankton in oceans are the most fundamental food source for marine creatures. The PACE satellite 
                        monitors the density of plankton, helping us understand how ocean ecosystems work. Regions with high 
                        plankton density are very important for fish and other marine creatures because more food is available
                         in these areas. Therefore, knowing where plankton are dense is very valuable for protecting marine life.

                            <br><br>

                            The PACE satellite measures cloud density in the atmosphere. Clouds play an important role in the 
                            formation of rain and changes in weather conditions. Clouds also affect Earth's temperature because 
                            they reflect sunlight and cool the Earth's surface. The PACE satellite helps in weather forecasting 
                            by monitoring how dense clouds are and their distribution over the world.

                        Oceans greatly affect Earth's climate. The PACE satellite helps us understand climate 
                        changes by monitoring ocean temperatures and plankton density. The warmer the ocean surface, 
                        the more evaporation occurs, leading to more cloud formation. These clouds cause rain, 
                        contributing to the balancing of the climate.

                        <br> <br>

                        How do clouds form, and how does the water cycle work? As observed by the PACE satellite, 
                        water evaporates and rises into the atmosphere, forming clouds when it cools. Then these clouds 
                        return as rain or snow. By doing simple experiments in the classroom, you can observe how water 
                        evaporates and how clouds form. This way, you can learn how the water cycle works.
